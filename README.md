# spring2024
* the lessons about spring boot

## LEARN
* CHANGELOG file and CHANGELOG_DETAILS folder
  * What I don't like about SB is how easy your app can fail to start
  * So I put all that errors (and logs) in the process down.
* feature branches
  * They are ordered from `feature/001-...` until `feature/022-readme`. And few more.  
  * Every difference between them is one lesson 

## RUN
* start docker
* ./startup-DB.bat (it will start 2 postgres databases)
* ./startup-LS.bat (it will compile and start app up)

## TESTS
* Just run them. They use H2 in memory db.
