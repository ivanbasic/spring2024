# Password Encoders Overview

| Prefix     | Modern | Description |
|------------|----|-------------|
| `{noop}`   | No | Plain text password, no hashing, for demos only |
| `{bcrypt}` | Yes | Adaptive hashing with built-in salt, default Spring choice |
| `{argon2}` | Yes | Memory-hard algorithm, resistant to GPU/ASIC attacks |
| `{ldap}`   | No | Legacy LDAP SSHA format, weak by modern standards |
| `{pbkdf2}` | No | Iterative hash, CPU-hard but not memory-hard |
| `{sha256}` | No | Fast hash without salt, vulnerable to brute-force |


BCrypt: 
* is the default password encoder in Spring Security, including 6.5.2.

Argon2:  
* a stronger optional encoder 
* whose parameter sets are versioned to avoid breaking existing hashes.
* For security-focused systems
* Argon2 is cryptographically superior
* But it has real-world tradeoffs:
  - requires native-quality crypto libs (Bouncy Castle)
  - higher memory usage
  - more operational risk for small JVMs
  - slower login under load
