# Password Encoders – Notes

Spring Security uses `DelegatingPasswordEncoder` to support multiple
password hashing strategies at the same time.

The encoder:
1. Reads the prefix from the stored password (e.g. `{argon2}`)
2. Selects the matching `PasswordEncoder`
3. Verifies the raw password against the stored hash

Important observations:
* BCrypt and Argon2 are modern and recommended
* PBKDF2, SHA-256, and LDAP are legacy and should not be used for new users
* BCrypt is self-describing; PBKDF2 is not version-safe
* Encoder version mismatches (e.g. PBKDF2 v5.5 vs v5.8) will break authentication
