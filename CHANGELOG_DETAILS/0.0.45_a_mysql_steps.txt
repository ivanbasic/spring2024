Step 1 – Current state
Read and analyze:
    SecurityConfig
    Current InMemoryUserDetailsManager
Identify:
    Current user(s)
    Password encoder
    Roles

Step 2 – Prepare DB3 for users
Add Spring Security default tables in DB3:
    users
    authorities
Add
    schema-db3.sql
    DataSourceInitializer (DB3 only)

Step 3 – Insert existing user into DB3
    Same username
    Same encoded password
    Same roles
    DB3 contains users, but app still uses in-memory auth

Step 4 – Switch authentication source
Replace:
    InMemoryUserDetailsManager
With:
    JdbcUserDetailsManager
    Explicitly wired to db3DataSource

Keep:
    Same PasswordEncoder
    Same HTTP security rules

Step 5 – Verify
    Login works with same credentials
    DB3 tables are queried
    In-memory auth no longer used

Step 6 – Cleanup
    Clean up Db1AutoConfiguration, Db2, Db3, use of qualifiers
    Clean up SecurityConfig. i didn't remove old beans, just commented them out:
        mySecurityFilterChain
        InMemoryUserDetailsManager
    Write Changelog, commit.
