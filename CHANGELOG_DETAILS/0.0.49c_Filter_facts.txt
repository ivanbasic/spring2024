FILTER FACTS

By adjusting logging levels the execution flow became visible:
- DefaultSecurityFilterChain will show [the list of filters]
- FilterChainProxy logs show when a request enters and leaves the security chain
- DispatcherServlet logs show when a request reaches MVC

Adding custom filters:
- Before an existing filter
- After an existing filter
- At the position of an existing filter

Old vs New Spring Boot:
- extends Filter vs extends OncePerRequestFilter
- doFilter() vs doFilterInternal()


Spring Security as a filter chain:
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Exception handling
- Request caching
- JWT / Basic auth
