# Actuator Monitoring
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      base-path: /manage
      exposure:
        include: health, info, metrics, beans
  endpoint:
    health:
      show-details: when_authorized
      group:
        db:
          include: db
        system:
          include: diskSpace, ping
```
Spring Boot’s health groups don’t override the default root endpoint (/manage/health).

Instead:

The root health endpoint always shows all indicators.
Even if you define additional-paths: health, it only adds an alias, it does not replace the default.
This is confirmed both in documentation and GitHub issues



## ACTUATOR SECURITY
In my Spring Boot application, I explicitly allowed open access to two actuator endpoints:

```
.requestMatchers("/manage/health", "/manage/info").permitAll()
```
This means these endpoints are Public:
- /manage/health 
- /manage/info 

All other endpoints are not listed in permitAll(), so Spring Security applies the fallback:
```
.anyRequest().authenticated()
```
This secures everything else, including:
- /manage/health/db
- /manage/health/system
- /manage/metrics/**
- /manage/beans
- any other Actuator or application endpoint not explicitly permitted
