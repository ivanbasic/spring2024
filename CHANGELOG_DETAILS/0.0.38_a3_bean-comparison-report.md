# 🔍 Bean Comparison Report

*Generated by Java Spring Boot Assistant (GPT) — April 2025*

This report compares the beans discovered via:

- 🟢 `BeanReader` (custom runtime scanner using `ApplicationContext.getBeanDefinitionNames()`)
- 🟡 Spring Boot Actuator `/manage/beans` endpoint

---

## 📊 Summary

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Beans in Actuator | 393 |
| Beans in BeanReader | 426 |
| Common Beans | 393 |
| Only in BeanReader | 33 |
| Only in Actuator | 0 ✅ |

---

## 🔎 Beans Only in BeanReader (sample)

These beans were found by `BeanReader` but not listed in Actuator's `/manage/beans`. They may include synthetic beans, internal Spring framework beans, or beans filtered by Actuator.

```text
listOfSpringBootBeans
transactionInterceptor
objectPostProcessor
data-jpa.repository-aot-processor#1
org.springframework.context.annotation.internalCommonAnnotationProcessor
jpa.EmployeeRepo.fragments#0
org.springframework.context.event.internalEventListenerFactory
...
```

---

## ✅ Conclusion

- Actuator's `/manage/beans` provides a structured and filtered view.
- `BeanReader` sees all raw context beans, including internal and synthetic ones.
- There are **no missing critical beans** in Actuator.
- Combining both approaches offers a full picture — great job integrating both!
