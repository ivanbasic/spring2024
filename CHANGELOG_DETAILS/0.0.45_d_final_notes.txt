At startup

Spring Security looks for:
1 SecurityFilterChain (mandatory)
2 AuthenticationManager (auto-built)
3 UserDetailsService (mandatory for username/password auth)
4 PasswordEncoder

provided:
SecurityFilterChain ✔
UserDetailsService ✔ (JdbcUserDetailsManager)
PasswordEncoder ✔

So Spring Security builds this pipeline:
HTTP request
 → SecurityFilterChain
 → AuthenticationManager
 → DaoAuthenticationProvider
 → UserDetailsService (JdbcUserDetailsManager)
 → Database (users / authorities)

Summary

Replacing
- InMemoryUserDetailsManager with
- JdbcUserDetailsManager works because both implement
- UserDetailsService, ...
allowing Spring Security to switch authentication sources without changing the security configuration.
